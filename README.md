# Jekyll LaTeX Block

Jekyll LaTeX Block is a plugin for [Jekyll][jekyll] that uses [KaTeX][katex] to
render LaTeX at build time, without the need for client-side JavaScript.

## Requirements

Ensure that your build environment has a JavaScript interpreter supported by
[ExecJS][execjs].

## Installation

Add this gem to your project's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-latex-block", "~> 0.13.2"
end
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

## Usage

In your content, you can use the `latex` block tag like so:

```latex
{% latex %}
e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0
{% endlatex %}
```

[Additional rendering options][rendering-opts] such as `displayMode` may be
specified like so:

```latex
{% latex displayMode=true %}
\int_{a}^a f(x) dx
{% endlatex %}
```

To display the resulting markup properly, you MUST include KaTeX CSS and
relevant web fonts on your site. The generated HTML _does not_ require KaTeX
client-side JavaScript.

### Easy-mode CSS & Fonts Integration :heavy_check_mark:

Place the following stylesheet just above your closing `</body>` tag.

<details>
<summary>Why not place it in the <tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt>?</summary>
CSS is a blocking resource. If this external resource is (a) placed in the head, and (b) were to not load (or slowly load) for whatever reason, it would block the entire page from rendering.
<br><br>
The official recommendation for using this plugin is "external CSS belongs at the end of the body". Ultimately, you can do whatever you want. :shrug:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.13.2/katex.min.css" integrity="sha512-el2z+rjIj40JeIlKyqcoRjGNjvwHVlyahNQ1PhSs4PCztr6jJ4GgpjgN+1a++L9HZxhLXpa4eLG3ry976z0O2Q==" crossorigin="anonymous" />
```

### Hard-mode CSS & Fonts Integration :warning:

For maximum control, you may wish to manually download KaTeX CSS / web fonts and
place them directly in your project. The author of this plugin is not
responsible for your pain and suffering should you choose to go this route.
